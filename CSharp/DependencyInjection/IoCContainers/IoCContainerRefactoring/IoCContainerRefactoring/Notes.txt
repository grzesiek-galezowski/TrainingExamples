- Change every registration (every scope) to lambda
- Replace singletons that are resolved in a single place
- Define Service Logic Root
- For every singleton that is used in more than one place,
   define accessor function and bind it to a field in the service logic root.
- Move root singleton (one on which other singletons don't depend) to service logic root and bind it to a field.
- Replace (very carefully) scoped and transients - if they are used in more than one place,
   follow a similar approach to singletons used in more than one place, but use factory methods rather than fields.
- Objects owned by ASP.Net Core must be passed as constructor
   or method parameters depending on their lifestyle
- Fix disposables
